# Evaluating_Correlations_-_CAPM_Betas_During_Market_Crises
This project analyzes whether correlations between stocks and CAPM betas increase during market crises using daily returns data for S&amp;P 500 stocks from 1980 to 2023. The study identifies market crises and evaluates statistical patterns to confirm or refute the saying "correlations go to one" during these periods.
